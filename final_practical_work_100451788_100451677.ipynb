We assume an internet surfer cliking random links and traversing pages. When it had done it long enough, the surfer can record how much time he has spent in each webpage. \n","\n","This will approximate the probability landing in each page when randomly surfint the internet. Thus, the pages that are more likely to be visited by a user will coincide to be the most important pages.\n","\n","As we have modelled the problem as a Markov Chain, and applying the **[Ergodic theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory)** getting the latter probabilities will exactly coincide with the **stationary** distribution of that Markov Chain.\n","\n","### Computing PageRank\n","The PageRank, that is, how much quality is inherent to any webpage, will be computed as the **Stationary distribution probabilities**, which represents how much time a user is likely to spend on a certain webpage.\n","\n","We will compute these stationary distribution in *brute-force* manner, by simulating the document traversing through the multiplication of the **transition matrix** with the **webpage probability vector**. When the difference between the probability vector at time $n-1$ and $n$ is less than a certain threshold $\\epsilon$, we can assume that we have reached the stationary distribution.\n"," $$r_n = M \\cdot r_{n-1} \\equiv |r_{n-1}-r_{n}| \\leq \\epsilon \\implies r_n \\mathtt{\\ stationary}$$\n","\n","### Damping factor\n","As explained in the latter paragraphs, we are using the *Random surfer model*. The problem is that if this random surfer reaches a page that has no outgoing links, which can happen, its search will stagnate. This is what is defined as a **Rank Sink**.\n","\n","To help avoid Rank sinks, we will set a probability of randomly jumping to any document in the database. This probability will be known as the damping factor $\\beta$.\n","\n","When visiting a document there will be a probability $\\beta$ of visiting a link inside the document, and a probability $(1-\\beta)$ of visiting a random document.\n","\n","This additionally solves for the requirement for the **Ergodic** theorem, that a Markov Chain must be fully connected to have a Stationary distribution.\n","\n","### Computing PageRank\n","In order to compute PageRank, we will have to build the transition Matrix $M$, containig the links which are connected.\n","\n",">NOTE: This matrix $M$ will not represent the fully connected transition matrix, as storing this in memory is highly inneficient. Instead, only the original links are stored in a Sparse Matrix.\n","\n","An initial uniform vector $R_0$ with probability values of $\\frac{1}{N}$ will be assumed.\n","\n",">N stands for the number of webpages.\n","\n","This vector will be updated in every iteration of the algorightm by being multiplied by the transition matrix.\n","\n","$$r_{n} = \\beta \\cdot ( M \\cdot r_{n-1}) + (1-\\beta) \\cdot u_{Nx1}$$\n","\n",">$(1-\\beta) \\cdot u_{Nx1}$ is the responsible for applying the damping factor, as our matrix $M$ is sparse.\n","\n","#### Injecting lost probability\n","$r_{n}$ represents a vector of probabilities, thus, it's L1 norm (manhattan distance) must always be one.\n","\n","There is a posibility, especially for low values of N, that due to the sparsity of matrix M, the L1 norm of the updated vector $r$ is less than 1.\n","\n","In this case we have to '*inject*' the lost probability. We will compute $d$, which corresponds with probability that is missing, and we will distribute it evenly through all the entries.\n","\n","$$d = ||r_n||_1 - ||r_{n-1}||_1$$\n","$$r_{n} = r_{n} + d \\cdot u_{Nx1}$$\n","\n","### Error tolerance\n","In order to compute the stationary distribution, we would technically have to update the vector $r$ infinitely. \n","As we cannot operate for eternity, we will compute the what is the difference between $r_n$ and $r_{n-1}$.\n","When this difference, which we will call $\\gamma$, is small enough, we will assume that the stationary distribution has been reached.\n","\n","### Convergence\n","Depending on the size of $N$, it will take more or take more or less iteratios to achieve convergence.\n","\n","In case of no convergence being reached, the loop will exit in the specified 20 iterations."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Implementation\n","The first thing we will have to do is to load in some libraries.\n","Apart from the typical python packages as `numpy`, `typing` and `pandas`, we will also have to import `re` to extract the outgoing links from each of the pages.\n","\n","### Data structures\n","In order to make the implementation as efficient as possible we will use Spark's distributed data structures.\n","\n","These are:\n","- `CoordinateMatrix`\n","- `DenseMatrix`\n","- `IndexedRowMatrix`\n","\n","Both `CoordinateMatrix` and `IndexedRowMatrix` are **sparse** datastructures. That is, they are expected to hold matrices with potentially lots of zeros. In order to be as efficient as possible, only the non-zero values of the matrices are stored, which is perfect for our use case as we are only interested in non-zero values (connections between documents).\n","\n","In the other hand, `DenseMatrix` will be used to hold the PageRank value vector, as there will be NO document containing a PageRank of zero.

Kubitzki, Volume VIII, Flowering Plants Eudicots Asterales; Springer 2006</ref>  The order is a [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolite]] (plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones), and includes mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] species, although a small number of trees (such as the [[Lobelia deckenii|giant Lobelia]] and the [[Dendrosenecio|giant Senecio]]) and [[shrub]]s are also present.  Asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common [[ancestor]]. Asterales share characteristics on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and biochemical levels.  [[Synapomorphies]] (a character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development) include the presence in the plants of [[oligosaccharide]] [[inulin]], a nutrient storage molecule used instead of [[starch]]; and unique [[stamen]] morphology. The stamens are usually found around the [[Gynoecium|style]], either aggregated densely or fused into a tube, probably an [[adaptation]] in association with the plunger (brush; or secondary) [[pollination]] that is common among the families of the order, wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil.  == Families == The order '''Asterales''' currently includes 11 families, the largest of which are the [[Asteraceae]], with about 25,000 species, and the [[Campanulaceae]] (\"bellflowers\"), with about 2,000 species. The remaining families count together for less than 500 species. The two large families are cosmopolitan, with many of their species found in the Northern Hemisphere, and the smaller families are usually confined to Australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes South America.  Only the Asteraceae have composite flower heads; the other families do not, but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the 11 families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the [[rosids]].  The name and order Asterales is botanically venerable, dating back to at least 1926 in the [[Hutchinson system| Hutchinson system of plant taxonomy]] when it contained only five families, of which only two are retained in the APG III classification. Under the [[Cronquist system]] of taxonomic classification of flowering plants, [[Asteraceae]] was the only family in the group, but newer systems (such as [[APG II system|APG II]] and [[APG III system|APG III]]) have expanded it to 11.<ref name=apweb>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/ |title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website |publisher=Mobot.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  ==Biogeography== The core Asterales are Stylidiaceae [six [[Genus|genera]]), APA [[clade]] (Alseuosmiaceae, Phellinaceae and Argophyllaceae (7 genera)] and MGCA clade (Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, Calyceraceae - total 20 genera), and Asteraceae (1600 genera). Other Asterales are Rousseaceae (four genera), Campanulaceae (84 genera) and Pentaphragmataceae (one genus).  All Asterales families are represented in the Southern Hemisphere; however, Asteraceae and Campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and Menyanthaceae nearly so.<ref>J.Lundberg 2009 Asteraceae and relationships within Asterales, Chapter 10 of Systematics, Evolution, and Biogeography of Compositae. IAPT,  Austria, p.159</ref>  ==Evolution== Although most extant species of Asteraceae are herbaceous, the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant, a tree or shrub, perhaps adapted to dry conditions, radiating from South America. Less can be said about the Asterales themselves with certainty, although since several families in Asterales contain trees, the ancestral member is most likely to have been a tree or shrub.  Because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere, it is natural to conjecture that there is a common southern origin to them. Asterales are [[angiosperms]], flowering plants that appeared about 140 million years ago. The Asterales order probably originated in the [[Cretaceous]] (145 – 66 [[Mya (unit)#Symbols y and yr|Mya]]) on the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] which broke up from 184 – 80 Mya, forming the area that is now Australia, South America, Africa, India and Antarctica.  Asterales contain about 14% of [[eudicot]] diversity. From an analysis of relationships and diversities within the Asterales and with their superorders, estimates of the age of the beginning of the Asterales have been made, which range from 116 Mya to 82Mya.<ref name=apweb/> However few fossils have been found, of the Menyanthaceae-Asteraceae clade in the [[Oligocene]], about 29 Mya.  Fossil evidence of the Asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs, so the precise estimation of the order's age is quite difficult. An Oligocene (34 – 23 Mya) pollen is known for Asteraceae and Goodeniaceae, and seeds from Oligocene and [[Miocene]] (23 – 5.3 Mya)  are known for Menyanthaceae and Campanulaceae respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |first1= K. |last1= Bremer |first2= M.

Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited.

On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the   [[Bundestag]], [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|voted to move the seat]] of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] merged several districts. The number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12. In 2006, the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|FIFA World Cup Final]] was held in Berlin.  ==Geography== {{main|Geography of Berlin}}  {{multiple image |align=center |image2=Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg |width2=363 |caption2=[[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]], the historical center: [[Unter den Linden]] boulevard in the foreground, high-rise buildings of [[Potsdamer Platz]] up to the right. |image1=Siegessaeule Aussicht 10-13 img4 Tiergarten.jpg |width1=310 |caption1= View from the Victory Column towards Mitte, Berlin, Germany in the 21st century.}}  ===Topography=== [[File:Visit-suomi-2009-05-by-RalfR-014.jpg|thumb|Aerial view over Berlin Mitte.]]  Berlin is situated in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau|Teltow Plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>  Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.  The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]] in the city's outskirts, and in the center the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg]]. While the latter measures {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the former both have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial hill composed of a [[Schuttberg|pile of rubble]] from the ruins of World War II.  ===Climate===  [[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]  Berlin has a [[Maritime temperate climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=58301&cityname=Berlin%2C+Berlin%2C+Germany&units=|title=Berlin, Germany Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref> There are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates.

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin — the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany — initiated ambitious (re-)construction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.  Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]]. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque facades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings is inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].  Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at e.g., [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]] and [[Alexanderplatz]]. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.  ===Architecture=== {{main|Architecture in Berlin}} [[File:Berlin, Kreuzberg, Chamissoplatz 4, Mietshaus.jpg|thumb|upright|A residential building in [[Kreuzberg]].]]  The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.  [[File:Brandenburger Tor morgens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]  The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, was remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.  The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.  The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.  [[File:Berlin potsdamer platz db haus atnight.jpg|thumb|[[Potsdamer Platz]] at night.]]  The [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and the construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as the reconstruction of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] is continuing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |title=Neumann: Stadtschloss wird teurer|work= Berliner Zeitung |language=de |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |title=Das Pathos der Berliner Republik|work= Berliner Zeitung |language=de |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Also located on the island and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]] and palace is [[Berlin Cathedral]], emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

[[File:Berlin Downtown Friedrichstraße.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Friedrichstraße]]]]  [[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.  [[File:Le château de Charlottenburg (Berlin) (6340508573).jpg|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]  The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.  The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].   West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War is the largest historical palace in Berlin.  The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.  {{See also|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}  ==Demographics== {{main|Demographics of Berlin}} [[File:Live8 berlin publikum.jpg|thumb|Young Berliners at the Tiergarten]]  On 31 December 2014, the city-state of Berlin had a population of 3,562,166 registered inhabitants<ref name=\"Population\">{{cite web|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/BasisZeitreiheGrafik/Bas-Einwohnerregister.asp?Ptyp=300&Sageb=12041&creg=BBB&anzwer=11|title=Einwohner am Ort der Hauptwohnung am 31.

In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.  Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 200,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]],<ref name=\"250k Turks\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=13 May 2007|accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

Each borough contains a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which often have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became urbanized and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities or boroughs. At present Berlin consists of 96 localities, which are commonly made up of several city neighborhoods—called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]—representing small residential areas.  Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The power of borough administration is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's governing mayor, which advises the senate. The localities have no local government bodies.  ===Sister cities=== {{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}  Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.<ref name=Berlinsistercities>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref> [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with sister city Los Angeles in 1967.

During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.  There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low energy consumption and unloaded during periods of high consumption.  In 1993 the power grid connections to the surrounding areas were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was built when West Berlin's electrical grid was not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the city's energy grid.  ===Health=== [[File:Berlin mitte spreebogenpark blick auf charite 10.08.2011 13-31-03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Charité]] university hospital.]]  Berlin has a long history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/Elitewettbewerb-Universitaeten;art304,2400973|title=Berlin leuchtet|first1=Anja|last1=Kühne|first2=Tilmann|last2=Warnecke|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}</ref> The modern history of medicine has been significantly influenced by scientists from Berlin.

(In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the ''[[Kernighan–Lin algorithm]]'', while the latter is styled ''[[Lin–Kernighan heuristic|Lin–Kernighan]]''.)  Kernighan was the software editor for [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall International]]. His \"Software Tools\" series spread the essence of \"C/Unix thinking\" with makeovers for [[BASIC]], [[Fortran|FORTRAN]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and most notably his \"[[Ratfor]]\" (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

Kubitzki, Volume VIII, Flowering Plants Eudicots Asterales; Springer 2006</ref>  The order is a [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolite]] (plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones), and includes mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] species, although a small number of trees (such as the [[Lobelia deckenii|giant Lobelia]] and the [[Dendrosenecio|giant Senecio]]) and [[shrub]]s are also present.  Asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common [[ancestor]]. Asterales share characteristics on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and biochemical levels.  [[Synapomorphies]] (a character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development) include the presence in the plants of [[oligosaccharide]] [[inulin]], a nutrient storage molecule used instead of [[starch]]; and unique [[stamen]] morphology. The stamens are usually found around the [[Gynoecium|style]], either aggregated densely or fused into a tube, probably an [[adaptation]] in association with the plunger (brush; or secondary) [[pollination]] that is common among the families of the order, wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil.  == Families == The order '''Asterales''' currently includes 11 families, the largest of which are the [[Asteraceae]], with about 25,000 species, and the [[Campanulaceae]] (\"bellflowers\"), with about 2,000 species. The remaining families count together for less than 500 species. The two large families are cosmopolitan, with many of their species found in the Northern Hemisphere, and the smaller families are usually confined to Australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes South America.  Only the Asteraceae have composite flower heads; the other families do not, but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the 11 families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the [[rosids]].  The name and order Asterales is botanically venerable, dating back to at least 1926 in the [[Hutchinson system| Hutchinson system of plant taxonomy]] when it contained only five families, of which only two are retained in the APG III classification. Under the [[Cronquist system]] of taxonomic classification of flowering plants, [[Asteraceae]] was the only family in the group, but newer systems (such as [[APG II system|APG II]] and [[APG III system|APG III]]) have expanded it to 11.<ref name=apweb>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/ |title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website |publisher=Mobot.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  ==Biogeography== The core Asterales are Stylidiaceae [six [[Genus|genera]]), APA [[clade]] (Alseuosmiaceae, Phellinaceae and Argophyllaceae (7 genera)] and MGCA clade (Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, Calyceraceae - total 20 genera), and Asteraceae (1600 genera). Other Asterales are Rousseaceae (four genera), Campanulaceae (84 genera) and Pentaphragmataceae (one genus).  All Asterales families are represented in the Southern Hemisphere; however, Asteraceae and Campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and Menyanthaceae nearly so.<ref>J.Lundberg 2009 Asteraceae and relationships within Asterales, Chapter 10 of Systematics, Evolution, and Biogeography of Compositae. IAPT,  Austria, p.159</ref>  ==Evolution== Although most extant species of Asteraceae are herbaceous, the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant, a tree or shrub, perhaps adapted to dry conditions, radiating from South America. Less can be said about the Asterales themselves with certainty, although since several families in Asterales contain trees, the ancestral member is most likely to have been a tree or shrub.  Because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere, it is natural to conjecture that there is a common southern origin to them. Asterales are [[angiosperms]], flowering plants that appeared about 140 million years ago. The Asterales order probably originated in the [[Cretaceous]] (145 – 66 [[Mya (unit)#Symbols y and yr|Mya]]) on the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] which broke up from 184 – 80 Mya, forming the area that is now Australia, South America, Africa, India and Antarctica.  Asterales contain about 14% of [[eudicot]] diversity. From an analysis of relationships and diversities within the Asterales and with their superorders, estimates of the age of the beginning of the Asterales have been made, which range from 116 Mya to 82Mya.<ref name=apweb/> However few fossils have been found, of the Menyanthaceae-Asteraceae clade in the [[Oligocene]], about 29 Mya.  Fossil evidence of the Asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs, so the precise estimation of the order's age is quite difficult. An Oligocene (34 – 23 Mya) pollen is known for Asteraceae and Goodeniaceae, and seeds from Oligocene and [[Miocene]] (23 – 5.3 Mya)  are known for Menyanthaceae and Campanulaceae respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |first1= K. |last1= Bremer |first2= M.

The city was founded ca. 350 by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian]] king [[Shapur II]], and located in the Sassanid province of [[Asōristān]]. Perisapora was sacked and burned by Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in April 363, during [[Julian's Persian expedition|his invasion]] of the [[Sassanid Empire]].<ref>G. W.

The name of the town was then changed to ''Anbar'' ([[Middle Persian]] word for \"[[granaries]]\").

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|to|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned center of the [[Roaring Twenties]].  The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.  [[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]] ([[Potsdamer Platz]], 1945).]]  In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]]. NSDAP rule effectively destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 160,000, representing one-third of all Jews in the country. Berlin's Jewish population fell to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's persecuted groups were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, starting in early 1943, were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450 Berlin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]].

The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>  [[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wall]] in 1986, painted on the western side.

However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.

West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the western powers. East Berlin included most of the historic center of the city. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|publisher=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}</ref> In 1961, East Germany began the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his \"''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''\" – speech in 1963 underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|publisher=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>  In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the Wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the   [[Bundestag]], [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|voted to move the seat]] of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] merged several districts. The number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12.

The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau|Teltow Plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>  Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.  The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]] in the city's outskirts, and in the center the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg]]. While the latter measures {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the former both have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin — the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany — initiated ambitious (re-)construction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.  Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]]. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque facades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings is inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].  Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at e.g., [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]] and [[Alexanderplatz]]. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.  ===Architecture=== {{main|Architecture in Berlin}} [[File:Berlin, Kreuzberg, Chamissoplatz 4, Mietshaus.jpg|thumb|upright|A residential building in [[Kreuzberg]].]]  The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.  [[File:Brandenburger Tor morgens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]  The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, was remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.  The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.  The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.  The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.

Each borough contains a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which often have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became urbanized and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities or boroughs. At present Berlin consists of 96 localities, which are commonly made up of several city neighborhoods—called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]—representing small residential areas.  Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The power of borough administration is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's governing mayor, which advises the senate. The localities have no local government bodies.  ===Sister cities=== {{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}  Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.<ref name=Berlinsistercities>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref> [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.  There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low energy consumption and unloaded during periods of high consumption.  In 1993 the power grid connections to the surrounding areas were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was built when West Berlin's electrical grid was not connected to those of East or West Germany.

After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [[counterculture]] gatherings. The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the clubs Watergate, [[Tresor]], [[E-Werk]], and [[Berghain]]. The [[KitKatClub]] and several other locations are known for sexually uninhibited parties.  Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time on the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or all weekend. ''Berghain'' features the ''Panorama Bar'', a bar that opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night. The ''Weekend Club'' near [[Alexanderplatz]] features a roof terrace that allows partying at almost any time of the day.  The [[SO36]] in [[Kreuzberg]] originally focused largely on [[punk music]], but today has become a venue for many performances. ''SOUND'', located from 1971 to 1988 in Tiergarten and today in Charlottenburg, gained notoriety in the late 1970s for its popularity with heroin users and other drug addicts as described in [[Christiane F.]]'s book ''Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christiane.hurz.at/ |title=Christiane F.-Page |publisher=Christiane.hurz.at |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>  [[File:In Berghain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berghain]]]]  Berlin has a long history of gay culture and according to some authors, in the 1920s the city was the ''Gay Capital of Europe''.
